# password-generator
I have trouble coming up with new passwords so I created this to help cut down the time to make one.

**Link to project:** https://imrandan.github.io/toronto-stargazer-nasa-api/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML - CSS - JavaScript

I started by looking at a Scrimba wireframe for this project and then creating the basic skeleton. I then worked on the JavaScript functions of password generation by writing scripts/functions to make sure they generate and display in their designated spot. I also added in a feature to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.


## Optimizations

I would redo some of the buttons and layout to make it more clean and organized.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned through experimenting with JavaScript's many useful features and trying out new scripts for myself.
